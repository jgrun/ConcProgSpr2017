Experimental results are at the bottom of each program.

I got that the shared counter was faster in all instances. I think this is
because the shared counter is using one variable and therefore needs to update
things in the cache less frequently. The n-element array needs to call the item
needed each time it wants to read or write. This also means that because the
n element doesn't use locks, there is a lot of spinning while pulling information
that the shared counter doesn't have to deal with.
